# Hooks for Directives: 
> Vue provides a series of hooks for custom directives. Each hook has the option of a few arguments. Here are the hooks that are available:

> bind — this occurs once when the directive is attached to the element.
> inserted — this occurs once the element is inserted into the parent DOM
> update — this occurs when the element updates, but children haven't been updated yet
> componentUpdated — this occurs once the component and the children have been updated
> unbind — this occurs once the directive is removed

>Each of these has el, binding and vnode arguments available to them. These arguments are:

``` bash
el — the element the binding sits on

binding — an object which contains the arguments that are passed into the hooks. There are many available arguments including name, value, oldValue, expression, arg and modifiers.

vnode — allows you to refer directly to the node in the virtual DOM if you need to.
```

## Both binding and vnode should be treated as read-only.

> update and componentUpdated both expose an additional argument called oldvnode. The oldvnode argument is used to differentiate between the older value passed and the newer value.

## Bind and update are the most useful of the five.
